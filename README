Per instructions from Box here:

    https://developer.box.com/docs/authentication-with-jwt#section-3-grant-access-in-enterprise-admin-console

This assumes you have Firebase in your path/able to be used by your app or script

    ("firebase/php-jwt": "dev-master" in your composer.json should do the trick)

I generated the public/private keys with this command:

    openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout box_private.key -out box_certificate_pub.crt

upload box_certificate_pub.crt to the console, and keep the private key for encoding/decoding locally.

If successful, the response/print out should be something like:

    stdClass Object
    (
        [access_token] => 9cRs9MT09243243223432hfuidsafjTRhUbaZPd3
        [expires_in] => 3708
        [restricted_to] => Array
            (
            )

        [token_type] => bearer
    )
